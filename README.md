# User Story
Music has always been a helpful tool with raising children. As a new mom/dad, aunt/uncle, or grandparent, I would love a way to easily play music based on babyâ€™s bed time and play time. With my hands full as it is, I would like an app that is simple, as I don't have time to look up playlists and search for songs.
